# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.
